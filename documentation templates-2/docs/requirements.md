## User Needs

### User stories
TODO: Write brief user stories to explain how various actors would interact with the system to accomplish a goal.
    Express these in the form from agile development:- As a (role) I want (goal) so that (benefit).

### Actors
TODO: List and describe the actors/users for this product.

### Use Cases
TODO: Describe each use case (at least one per team member).
    Give each use case a unique ID, e.g. UC1, UC2, ...
    Summarise these using the use-case template below.

|  USE-CASE ID  | UC1| 
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Description** |Users can search for food hygiene ratings and find restaurants with good ratings and report a food safety issue. |
| **Actors** |Users |
|**Assumptions** | <ul><li>The user knows the name, location, or rating of the restaurant.</li><li>The user is familiar with using web apps and entering search terms.</li><li>The user has access to an internet device.</li><li>The food business being searched has a hygiene rating available on the platform.</li></ul> |</td></tr>
| **Steps** | 1. User opens the web app.<br>2. User enters a search term, such as the restaurant name, location, or selects a rating filter.<br>3. The system sends a request to the API.<br>4. The web app displays the food hygiene ratings.<br>5. If no results are found, the app displays a message saying, “No results found,” and suggests alternative actions. |

|**Variations** | TODO: OPTIONAL - Any variations in the steps of a use case |
| **Non-functional** | TODO: OPTIONAL - List of non-functional requirements that the use case must meet. |
| **Issues** | TODO: OPTIONAL - List of issues that remain to be resolved |






|  USE-CASE ID  | UC2| 
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Description** | TODO: Goal to be achieved by use case and sources for requirement |
| **Actors** | TODO: List of actors involved in use case |
| **Assumptions** | TODO: Pre/post-conditions if any</td></tr>
| **Steps** | TODO: Interactions between actors and system necessary to achieve goal |
| **Variations** | TODO: OPTIONAL - Any variations in the steps of a use case |
| **Non-functional** | TODO: OPTIONAL - List of non-functional requirements that the use case must meet. |
| **Issues** | TODO: OPTIONAL - List of issues that remain to be resolved |











|  USE-CASE ID  | UC3| 
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Description** | TODO: Goal to be achieved by use case and sources for requirement |
| **Actors** | TODO: List of actors involved in use case |
| **Assumptions** | TODO: Pre/post-conditions if any</td></tr>
| **Steps** | TODO: Interactions between actors and system necessary to achieve goal |
| **Variations** | TODO: OPTIONAL - Any variations in the steps of a use case |
| **Non-functional** | TODO: OPTIONAL - List of non-functional requirements that the use case must meet. |
| **Issues** | TODO: OPTIONAL - List of issues that remain to be resolved |

## Software Requirements Specification
### Functional requirements
TODO: create a list of functional requirements. 
    e.g. "The system shall ..."
    Give each functional requirement a unique ID. e.g. FR1, FR2, ...
    Indicate which UC the requirement comes from.


### Non-Functional Requirements
TODO: Consider one or more [quality attributes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_9126) to suggest a small number of non-functional requirements.
Give each non-functional requirement a unique ID. e.g. NFR1, NFR2, ...

Indicate which UC the requirement comes from.
