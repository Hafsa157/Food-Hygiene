Project Proposal 

Business Case 

Planning 

Problem statement 

The problem addressed by this project is people find it challenging to quickly check the hygiene standards of food and the lack of reliable up-to-date information on food hygiene ratings for local businesses, making it difficult to decide where to eat or shop. While Food hygiene ratings are available online, the information is scattered across different websites and isn't easily accessible. This makes it difficult for people to quickly check how clean a food business is before they visit. 


Business benefits 

● Customers will easily be able to access information about how clean food businesses are, helping them choose safer places to eat. 

● It will encourage businesses to maintain higher hygiene standards since their ratings will be public to everyone.  

● It will be easier to access and understand hygiene ratings, without the need to search through different websites.  

● It will increase customer engagement and will make people want to use the app regularly.  

 

Options Considered 

● Manually searching Bristol open data council websites, however it will be difficult because the information is scattered and not easily accessible. 

● Third-party apps may show food hygiene ratings but often lack full information for Bristol and are not regularly updated.  

● The Food Standard Agency (FSA) has a website that provides food hygiene ratings; however, it may not be easy to use or offer the additional features that this project aims to provide easier search options and better layout and design.  

 
 Expected Risks 

● We need to ensure that the data is updated regularly to reflect real-time hygiene ratings. 

● There will be challenges in convincing users to switch to this platform from other established services. 

● Dealing with technical difficulties when connecting various data sources or API failures could disrupt the availability of hygiene data. 

● Managing limited time might affect how many features we can add to our web app. 

● Making sure the platform is easy to navigate, use and understand.  

● The platform deals with public data, so we need to ensure that the system has strong security and is protected from unauthorised access or data tampering. 


Project Scope  

● A map showing food hygiene ratings for Bristol based businesses. 

● Users can search to find businesses by name and location. 

● Users can hover and click to view detailed hygiene information about each business. 

● Users can view real-time from the Bristol Open Data API.
